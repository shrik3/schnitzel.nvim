**Branches**  
The master branch is a "stable" version that I share publically. If you want a
out-of-box setup, this is what you go for. The "my-own" branch is the up-to-date
dotfiles that I daily drive. You are welcome to take a look, but do expect
frequent breaking changes.

# What is
schnitzel.nvim is my personal neovim configuration. 
If you want a cleaner (and much likely better) starting point, checkout the
[starter templetes out there](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim#starter-templates)

**What's it good for**  
- it's minimal
- it's a basic collection of plugins and configs that works out-of-the box for
  most use cases
- lua as first-class citizen but there's also room for the old good vimscript

**How should I use this one?** -- I suggest the following:
1. simply look around and find what's interesting for you, I'm happy if this
   could add to your armory.
2. if you want to actually use this config, it's better to **fork it and, never
   come back** to pull again: I'll try to keep the master as stable as I can but
   breaking changes are expected. My workflow, needs, and taste will also change
   over time. I can't promise you a smooth experience in the long term.

**Where can I learn about neovim / find resources**
- As always, read the friend manuals. Also the `:help <something>` command has
  good coverage.
- Run the vim tutor if you are an absolute beginner. The `vimtutor` program
  is ususally installed together with vim. In neovim you can also call `:Tutor`.
- rockerBOO's [awesome-neovim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim#starter-templates)
    is a great collection of plugins and other useful stuffs.
- If you want to build a configuration of you own, take a look at the 
    [starter templetes](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim#starter-templates)
    in the awesome-neovim repo

**Build what you use, and use what you build**

# Prerequisites
- neovim 0.9 + 
- install a [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) 
- install [ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags) for plugin tagbar
- install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

# Get started
**Backup your old nvim configs**  
e.g. `~/.config/nvim`

**Download Schnitzel.nvim**
clone this repo and dump everything into your config dir. e.g.
```
git clone https://github.com/shrik3/schnitzel.nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

**Launch neovim and sync the plugins**:  
and let Lazy.nvim handle the plugins initialization for the first time. Then
**restart neovim**. Should you run into troubles, try `:checkhealth lazy`. To
update the plugins use `:Lazy sync`

# How to use - Perks:
First, check my cheatsheet.txt to get started.

**How to configure and use LSPs**  
Again, check the cheatsheet for basic LSP commands (e.g. goto def.). Note that
you need to install the language server manually:
check [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig#Suggested-configuration).
To add a LSP server, edit `/lua/plugin_config/lspconfig.lua`.

**How to work with Markdown and Latex**  
This setup comes with basic markdown and latex support.


# How to customize
First take a look at how the configs are organized in the following section.

**To install a new plugin**:  
For plugins that requires only a few or no configs, you can add a line in
`lua/plugins/init.lua`.  Otherwise it's recomennded to split the config into a
separate file: use `lua/plugins/template.txt` as a template. Lazy.nvim will
automacally scan the `plugins` folder and load the config files in it.

I don't know if dotfiles need a license. But if you care, consider this public

# Notes

For markdown preview, edit `/lua/plugin_config/markdown`, set your
markdown preview browser by editting e.g. `let g:mkdp_browser = 'firefox'`.
**PRIVACY NOTE!** by default the markdown previewer is open to local network,
i.e. any machine from the same local network can access you being-previewed
document. This is handy if you want to e.g. share document across devices. Make
sure to turn this off if you are in a public network. To do this turn off this
option:
```
let g:mkdp_open_to_the_world = 1
```

To start a markdown preview, type `:MarkdownPreview`.

For latex preview, find the following line in the `/lua/plugins.lua` and set
your previewer:
```
vim.g.livepreview_previewer = 'zathura'
```

To start a preview, type `:LLPStartPreview`
